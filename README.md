## About the project

This project is my implementation of the "Wave Function Collapse" algorithm.
The program is designed to generate an output pattern of arbitrary size,
given a small image as its input, such that at any small environment in the
output image, there is a resemblance to the input image.

This implementation of the algorithm is written with functional programming
design in mind, and enables runtime rendering of the collapse process,
pattern extraction and viewing (unrelated to the actual algorithm run), and
saving the result of each algorithm run both as an image of the final
product and as a video of the collapse process itself.

## Wave Function Collapse explained

The "wave function collapse" algorithm, as it is used in computer science
and game design, is a technique that generates random but coherent
sequences of events or states (in our case, this is the output image). The
algorithm is based on the idea of the wave function collapse from quantum
mechanics, where a system in a superposition of states collapses into a single
definite state.

The input parameters for the algorithm include the initial state of the
system (in our case, all patterns are valid in all cells), a set of rules for
the possible transitions between states, and a probability distribution for
those transitions (as gathered from the input data). The algorithm proceeds in
steps, in each step a new state is selected according to the transition rules
and probability distribution.

The stages of the algorithm are as follows:

1. **Initialization:** This step can be broken into 3 parts:
    - The algorithm interprets the input, and gathers from it all possible
      states and patters for each cell of the wave.
    - The algorithm gathers the transition rules, meaning which patterns or
      states can relate to each other and in what way.
    - The 'wave' (which is a matrix with width and height of the output, and
      with depth corresponding to the number of patterns gathered) is
      initiated, with all patterns valid in all the cells.
2. **Observe:** A new state (a specific pattern in a specific cell) with
   the minimal entropy (i.e. the minimal number of patterns possible) is
   selected according to the transition rules and probability distribution:
   In case of a draw in entropy, the algorithm will choose a cell randomly
   from all cells with minimal entropy. After a cell with minimal entropy
   is found, it is collapsed (a pattern is chosen for it, and it is no
   longer in superposition) using the probability distribution of the
   patterns.
3. **Propagate:** The wave's state is now updated, with all cells affected
   by the collapse of the cell in the previous step updated to hold only
   valid patterns.
4. **Repeat:** The algorithm continues to repeat steps 2 and 3 until all
   cells - and by that the wave - are fully collapsed.
   The output of the algorithm is the collapsed wave, meaning that at each
   cell, only one pattern is valid, and will be selected for the output image.

This algorithm is widely used in game design, to generate random but coherent
levels, items, enemies, etc. in a game, but also in other fields such as
natural language processing, music generation, art, and many others.

## Requirements

The program requires the following to run:

```
Python 3.7.3+
numpy~=1.23.4
moviepy~=1.0.3
Pillow~=10.0.1
matplotlib~=3.6.1
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avihuxp/WaveFunctionCollapse.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages - using the supplied requirements.txt, run:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

## Usage

Run the program, with the following usage:

```bash
 python3 wave_function_collapse.py <input_path> <pattern_size> <out_height> <out_width> [flip] [rotate] [render_iterations] [render_video]
```

where parameters are:

1. **`path_to_input_image`** - `str`: The path to the input image for the
   algorithm, i.e. the base pattern.
2. **`pattern_size`** - `int`: The size of the square sub images of the input
   image, should be as small as possible for efficiency, and large
   enough to capture the largest basic feature in the input image.
3. **`out_height \ out_width`** - `int`s: the size, in pixels, of the
   output of the program.

***Optional parameters***

1. **`flip`** -  `bool`: Default is `False`, if `True`, the output
   will be able to include flipped (horizontally and vertically)
   versions of every pattern extracted from the input image.
2. **`rotate`** -  `bool`: Default is `False`, if `True`, the output
   will be able to include rotated (by 90&deg;, 180&deg;, and 270&deg;)
   versions of every pattern extracted from the input image.
3. **`render_iterations`** -  `bool`: Default is `True`, if `True`, will
   render the state of the wave every `NUM_OF_ITERATIONS_BETWEEN_RENDER = 15`
   iteration using matplotlib figure.
4. **`render_video`** -  `bool`: Default is `True`, if `True`, after
   collapsing the wave, will save a video of the collapsing of the wave,
   see additional info in the following section.

***Other parameters inside the program***

These parameters are found at the top of the python file, and can be
changed before running:

#### Render in runtime parameters:

- `NUM_OF_ITERATIONS_BETWEEN_RENDER = 15`  - The number of iterations
  between rendering in runtime
- `SHOW_PATTERNS = False` - Set to True to render all patterns and their
  probabilities
- `SAVE_PATTERNS = False` - Set to True to save all patterns to file
- `PRINT_RULES = False` - Set to True to print out all adjacency rules

#### Video rendering parameters:

- `DEFAULT_FPS = 30`  - Fps of the output video
- `DEFAULT_VIDEO_LENGTH = 6`  - Length of the output video
- `DEFAULT_OUT_VID_HEIGHT = 1000`  - Vertical size (in pixels) of the output
  video, which will preserve the original aspect ratio

## Features

- [x] Generate outputs from both RGB and GrayScale images.
- [x] Render images of the collapse progress in runtime using matplotlib.
- [x] Output the result of the algorithm to a large size image for better
  viewing experience.
- [ ] Improved runtime performance
- [ ] Added support for initial wave states (i.e. letting the wave function
  know about sky / ground / walls in the input image).
- [ ] Wrap around support for pattern extraction.
- [ ] Add a "Stride" option for pattern extraction, rules initialization,
  and propagation, so that this code will be able to run the tiled variant
  of the WFC algorithm.
- [ ] add video of usage with different output options to README
